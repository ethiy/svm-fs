# SVM and Feature Selection

## Practical session

For the practical session, you need to install `jupyter` in order to work on the notebook. You also need the last `scikit-learn` version `v0.19`.

### Install

For Unix based systems, if you already have `python3` and its package manager `pip3` you just have to execute these lines.

```bash
sudo -H pip3 install jupyter
sudo -H pip3 install scikit-learn
```

If you just want to upgrade a package, just type:

```bash
sudo -H pip3 install -U scikit-learn
```

For Windows, You can either:
* install `python3` and `pip3` and add them to your `%PATH%`;
* or just install `anaconda` for `python3` form [here](https://www.anaconda.com/download/#windows).

To run the notebook, you just have to go to the right directory and launch it via:

```bash
$ cd /path/to/folder
$ jupyter notebook
```
